# Hired by the Combine

- The Combine seek to hire powerful players as Advisors
- They target random players in the top 25 and always target [[Anti Citizen]] because they have chaotic energy and it's funny if they're Advisors
- The Council comes together to vote on matters of oppression and causes chaos with [[Combine Propaganda]]
- Players on the Council are encouraged to act selfishly while being an Advisor
- access to unique [[Crate Drops]] with unique effects
