Portal Storms are dispatched randomly over time or manually
# Dispatch

^140871

- Portal Storms have a random [[Portal Storm#^6b0cf0|magnitude]] assigned to them on dispatch

- Portal Storms have a random travel time until hitting Earth
	- travel time variance and fuzziness increases with magnitude
	- Arrival Time is determined at time of dispatch but [[Timer#^89eefc|fuzzy]] to Earth




# Initial Detection

As soon as a storm is detected, a large timer is added to the website, displaying the estimated time until arrival

based on global investment in [[$APERTURE]]:

- Earth can detect the dispatch time of an incoming storm earlier
- Storm Magnitude is displayed more precisely

- Estimated Arrival Time is measured and displayed dynamically based on current investment
- Estimated Magnitude is measured and displayed dynamically based on current investment


# Magnitude Categories

^6b0cf0

## weak

- dispatched most frequently
	- every 12 - 18h
- medium variance in travel time
	- 15min - 4 hours
- power level 1 - 7

## medium

- dispatched less frequently
	- every 24 - 48h
- medium large variance in travel time
	- 60min - 8 hours
- power level 8 - 24

## strong

- dispatched infrequently
	- every 3-5 days
- large variance in travel time
	- 30min - 48h
- power level 48 - 128

## catastrophic

- dispatched manually

- specific arrival time tied to real life events (for example TGA / Raising The Bar rerelease)



# Arrival

Once a Portal Storm arrives at Earth, the [[Combine Invasion]] begins
