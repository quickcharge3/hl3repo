# Example Timer

[[Impending Portal Storm]] is a Timer

# Use of Timers

- Timers can create suspense and are funny and exciting in large numbers

- The [[Combat System]] uses timers to create a mix of plannability, suspense and reward



# Fuzzy Timers

- Fuzzy Timers have some uncertainty that reduces over its duration (think of the progress bar of a file copy operation that keeps going up and down)

- Where Timers are fun, Fuzzy Timers create even more suspense and are even more fun

- The [[Space Weather Report]] mechanic makes use of a fuzzy timer
	- investment in [[$APERTURE]] determines certainty of measurement
