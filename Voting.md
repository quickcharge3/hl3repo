# Voting

- Voting is fun, impactful and creates narratives

- Players playing as an [[Advisor]] get to call votes for the [[Advisor Council]]
	- We'll need a way to enable the Advisor role for specific accounts

# Council Decisions

- The Council decides which of the [[Combine Abilities]] they want to use and when

- Think of it as a mix between "Twitch plays Pokémon" and an MMO-Boss that is activating its abilities based on player votes

- Calling a vote has a per-account Cooldown
