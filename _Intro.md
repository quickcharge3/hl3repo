This document proposes a cyclical Game Loop that offers players the opportunity to play in two distinct roles ([[Rebellion]] or [[Advisor]]), as well as a *Tribal Wars* *(https://www.tribalwars.co.uk)* inspired [[Combat System]], letting players collectively fight [[Combine Invasion]] and [[Combine Occupation]].

The Game Loop is defined over these separate [[Gameplay Periods]]:

1) [[Peace and Trade]]
2) [[Impending Portal Storm]]
3) [[Combine Invasion]] 
4) [[Combine Occupation]] 
5) [[Rebellion Victory]]

Player Experience:

1) Players are at ease - get to watch number go up, talk shit and throw tomatoes 🍻
2) Players are in suspense - share an unknown enemy, get to become a hero: large defensive investment 💰🔫
3) Players are excited - Earth fights against the first wave of Combine Invasion ⚔
4) Players were defeated but are engaged - plan, coordinate, play as Rebellion or Advisor [✊/👿]
5) Players are rewarded - medals are given out and tracked on a leaderboard 🥇🥈🥉


The [[Economics]]:

1) Number go up brr 📈📈📈
2) Number needs to come down because other number needs to go up 📈📉📊
3) Wealth is destroyed by the combine attack 📉💥💰
4) [[Combine]] attacks on funds keeps stock prices in check, [[Advisor]] attempt to min max 📊📈
5) [[Medals]] are cosmetic, no benefit other than goodwill 

The Game Balance:

1) There will never be a truly fair and stable economy, let's be real here
2) Extremely rich players need to invest their wealth in earth's defence for the benefit of all - or become Advisors
3) The Combine Invasion Force is very powerful and can only be beaten if >85% of earth's total wealth is invested in Defense 
4) The Combine Occupation is oppressive initially but can always be beaten by the Rebels
	1) [[Crate Drops]] and the [[Global Hope Buff]] provide escalating odds to the Rebellion
	2) Advisor Players get to enjoy their time of being evil but pay a price in stock, points and lost honor once the occupation ends
	3) Advisors must balance their short term fun with their long term goals
5) If we need to, we tweak some numbers, this is probably not going to be perfect first try
6) Since we defined a dramaturgy and can tweak the numbers, it'll eventually work fine


What's Missing:
