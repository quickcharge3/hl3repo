## fun silly features

These features could be fun to implement and add to the character of the site
	I don't know how difficult some of these are to implement

- [[Combine Abilities#^f8e434|Propaganda]] in chat for anti citizen

- adding a new stock option ([[$APERTURE]])

- Test a voting system for the Advisor Council
	- assign players as advisors, change their leaderboard icon and have a secret vote
	- the vote is announced to all players

- [[Portal Storm]] Timer
	- we can start teasing the portal storm once [[$APERTURE]] fund is in the game
	- after players got used to the fund existing and it has received some investment, drop a storm warning on the site
	- we can test the [[Timer#^89eefc|Fuzzy Timer]] interaction with the science fund


## complex features

- [[Combat System]]
	- I'll run the numbers and deal with balance so you can focus on implementation
		- I've done one iteration of this but will go over it again after finishing this doc (tomorrow)

- [[Overwatch]]
	- ties into your existing [[Anti Citizen]] system and extends it by also watching the stock market and [[Combine Occupation]] Health amount

## design / graphics

I can efficiently help with anything that is design related - collecting/organizing images / making UI mock-ups / creating icons etc

- [ ] [[UI]]
	- there need to be a number of UI elements added to the site
	- some of these integrate with existing ones ([[Leaderboards]])
		- others are completely new ([[Voting]] / [[Advisor]] Health)

- [ ] [[Leaderboards]]

- [ ] [[Crate Drops]] might need some new icons etc - I can do that
